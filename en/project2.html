            <p class="subpage-text"> Based on multimedia sources, we conducted extensive research to filter out relevant topics and interesting stories, which we then organized clearly through visual mapping.<br><br>  
                We then developed a concept to convey the collected content through an engaging guide. Additionally, we sketched appropriate visualization models based on the data and information, with the aim of either adjusting existing representations or developing new compositions.</p>

            <div class="caption gallery">Based on a concept that we developed through our research and considerations on storytelling, we sketched out a total of five double pages. We then focused on various elements—whether diagrammatic visualization models, illustrations, icons, or content texts. This allowed us to insert the individual elements into the respective layouts step by step and adjust them again, both in their entirety and in terms of color atmosphere. <br><br>
                Since we were working with individual DIN A3 pages, we also created test prints to check the effect of the scaling.

                At the same time, we designed a digital tablet application and created an interactive prototype. In doing so, we prepared additional content related to the brochure and conveyed it in an experiential way through various interactions.</p>

            <div class="caption gallery">Printing and binding the brochure ultimately proved more difficult than expected. The height was 420 mm and the width 297 mm for each of the 12 pages that had to be bound together. The reason for this was that we created a leporello, in which all pages are folded into a bundle. In addition, we could only print individual sections, as the maximum print width was 1600 mm. With a lot of effort and hard work, we finally cut the three sections to size, glued them together, and folded them.</div>
