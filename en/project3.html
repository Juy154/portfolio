                    <p class="subpage-text description">In everyday life, people consume a variety of media. Often, we stop at a certain point, even though we're not finished, and have to attend to other commitments due to time constraints. The more content we consume simultaneously, the more confusing it becomes when we want to pick up paused content again later. <br><br> 
                        Based on this personal issue, I attempted to develop a design solution in the form of a mobile application that addresses my current needs. Additionally, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into the design tool Figma.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p class="subpage-text">First, I considered which steps were necessary to achieve specific goals. To do this, I delved deeply into user flows and analyzed the individual steps in order to sketch the basic structure of the mobile application based on this. It’s important to mention that I consciously decided against integrating community features at the outset. My focus was on creating a system that allows for easy and clear storage and retrieval of content – and that alone is complex enough.<br><br> 
                In the next step, I sketched rough layouts to determine the placement of elements as well as the interactive features required. Additionally, I created a color palette to clearly and cohesively represent the layout and interactions through the use of color.</p>

            <div class="caption gallery">Here you can see different versions of a user flow. They helped me a lot to identify the necessary features and services and enabled me to think through different usage scenarios in order to design the structure and interactions in a meaningful way.</div>

            <h2>Result</h2>
            <p class="subpage-text">Finally, I developed a concept within Figma. In the process, I began creating a design system that includes styles, variables, and tokens. This allowed me to efficiently standardize the UI elements. An interesting aspect was also the option to offer different modes to enable user personalization, which had to be taken into account in the design.<br><br> 
                Ultimately, I created an interactive prototype based on typical user scenarios.</p>

I am convinced that this experience will also be of great benefit to me in future projects. <br><br>
                Note: As part of my process, I also used real images to give a realistic idea of what the application might look like. For legal reasons, however, you will not see any screenshots or videos here, as I mainly used images from the internet.</div>
